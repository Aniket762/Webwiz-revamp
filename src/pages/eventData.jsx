    description:
      `With the advent and rising popularity of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, Blockchain is a new term heard more frequently than not. For the unversed, Blockchain is a specific type of database that chains data together in chronological order, which makes it impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
      To help finance enthusiasts understand this topic more thoroughly, Webwiz choreographed a workshop on Blockchain earlier this year, in February. We had with us, CEO and Co-founder of Collabrains and an excellent Blockchain speaker, Mr. Pranjal Bharadwaj, who addressed the concerns and questions of curious participants and boosted our knowledge on this seemingly complicated topic.

      `Freshers often find themselves exposed to various potential interests and choices to select from. Be it competitive programming, web development, or building projects - without proper guidance, it'd all seem perplexing for a newbie. Webwiz, in association with Prepbytes, attempted to give an insight into this very topic by hosting an online workshop on "When and How to Start Building Projects?". Mamta Kumari, the Co-founder of Prepbytes, former SDE of Amazon and Samsung, and an expert mentor, graced us with her invaluable guidance and helped students understand how to approach their interests systematically. The event was fruitful and witnessed student's curious questions and active participation.

      `Webwiz, in collaboration with Postman, had organized a super informative, hands-on session on API, called APIs 101, to help students and techno-worms learn API essentials. API or Application Programming Interface is a framework that encapsulates more complex and more used codes and gives a more straightforward syntax for its utilization, allowing faster communication for servers.
      This event, held towards the end of March, was significant for Webwiz as a club as it got to work together with Postman, which is currently the world's leading collaboration platform for API development.

      `Getting into big tech companies like Microsoft can be a far-fetched ambition for many. While struggling to sharpen our skills and improve our knowledge, a speck of motivation from the achievers themselves can wonderfully spice up the monotonous preparation period.
      Vaibhav Kohad (CS- 2021) transformed this ambition into reality as he grabbed a PPO into Microsoft. In a live, interactive session titled, *The Secret Ingredients to get into Microsoft*, an all-smiles Kohad talked us through his remarkable journey from being a newbie to a coder of such caliber. Having hosted a lively session that undoubtedly inspired all those who attended, Webwiz left yet another mark in its trail of successful events.

Organized in collaboration with Cyborg, HackEcho was a 24-hour event that started with a workshop by Alon Grinshpoon, followed by a mini-challenge. Alon Grinshpoon, the Co-founder and CEO of EchoAR, is a high believer in Augmented and Virtual reality (AR/VR) and guided the participants to make awesome AR/VR projects. He also served as the judge for the mini-challenge, which required the participants to develop any small AR/VR-based project. The event had over 200 registrations from 30+ colleges in India and 10+ colleges abroad. It was a superb first-time experience for the club members and laid a firm foundation for many such events in the future.`,
